CONSTRUCTOR, STATIC VARIABLES AND STATIC BEHAVIOR
Example: Product Class

REVISION: ENCAPSULATION

Encapsulation means:

Data members are private

Access is controlled using public methods (getters and setters)

Example:

class Product {

private String name;
private double price;

public void setName(String name) {
    this.name = name;
}

public String getName() {
    return name;
}

public void setPrice(double price) {
    if (price > 0) {
        this.price = price;
    }
}

public double getPrice() {
    return price;
}


}

Encapsulation ensures:

Data is protected

Validation can be applied

Object remains in valid state

CONSTRUCTOR

Definition:
A constructor is a special method used to initialize an object.

Rules:

Same name as class

No return type (not even void)

Automatically called when object is created

Example:

class Product {

private String name;
private double price;

Product(String name, double price) {
    this.name = name;
    this.price = price;
}


}

Object creation:

Product p1 = new Product("Laptop", 80000);

Constructor runs automatically.

DEFAULT CONSTRUCTOR

A constructor with no parameters.

Example:

Product() {
name = "Unknown";
price = 0;
}

If no constructor is written, Java provides a default constructor automatically.

PARAMETERIZED CONSTRUCTOR

A constructor that receives values.

Example:

Product(String name, double price) {
this.name = name;
this.price = price;
}

Why use parameterized constructor?

Forces object to have valid data at creation

Avoids incomplete objects

CONSTRUCTOR VS SETTER

Constructor:

Initializes object during creation

Called automatically

Setter:

Modifies value after object creation

Called manually

Constructor is for initialization.
Setter is for modification.

STATIC VARIABLE

Definition:
A static variable belongs to the class, not to objects.

Only one copy exists in memory.

Example:

class Product {

private String name;
private double price;
private static int totalProducts = 0;

Product(String name, double price) {
    this.name = name;
    this.price = price;
    totalProducts++;
}


}

Every time a Product object is created,
totalProducts increases.

Usage:

System.out.println(Product.totalProducts);

Static variable is accessed using class name.

WHY STATIC?

Use static when:

Value is shared among all objects

It represents common property

Example:

class Product {

private String name;
private double price;
static String storeName = "ABC Store";


}

All products share same storeName.

If we change:

Product.storeName = "XYZ Store";

All products reflect this change.

STATIC METHOD

Definition:
A method that belongs to class, not to objects.

Example:

public static int getTotalProducts() {
return totalProducts;
}

Called as:

Product.getTotalProducts();

No object required.

IMPORTANT RULES ABOUT STATIC

Static method can access only static variables directly.

Static method cannot use "this".

Static variable is shared.

Instance variables belong to each object separately.

FULL EXAMPLE FOR CLASS DEMONSTRATION

class Product {

private String name;
private double price;
private static int totalProducts = 0;

Product(String name, double price) {
    this.name = name;
    this.price = price;
    totalProducts++;
}

public String getName() {
    return name;
}

public double getPrice() {
    return price;
}

public static int getTotalProducts() {
    return totalProducts;
}


}

Main method:

public class Test {

public static void main(String[] args) {

    Product p1 = new Product("Laptop", 80000);
    Product p2 = new Product("Mobile", 40000);
    Product p3 = new Product("Tablet", 30000);

    System.out.println("Total Products: " + Product.getTotalProducts());
}


}

Output:
Total Products: 3

INSTANCE VS STATIC

Instance variable:

Separate copy for each object

Accessed using object

Static variable:

Single copy

Shared by all objects

Accessed using class name

IMPORTANT CONCEPT QUESTION

Why is main method static?

Because Java must call it without creating an object.
